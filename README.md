# Would You Rather...?

This application lets a user play the “Would You Rather?” game. The game goes like this: A user is asked a question in the form: “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?”. Answering "neither" or "both" is against the rules.

## Installation

To run the application you need:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install` or `yarn` (if you have yarn on your local machine)
* start the server with `npm start`
